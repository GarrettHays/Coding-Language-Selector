    <h1>Coding School: Track Selector Tool</h1>

    <p>Thank you for your interest in joining Epicodus - we are glad you're here!</p>
    
    <p>We know choosing to set out on a new adventure of growth and discovery in the world of technology can be a bit overwhelming, but choosing a language to learn is your first step. With that in mind, we have created a simple, easy-to-use Track Selector tool to hopefully help make that decision easier.</p>

    <p>The Track Selector Tools is as easy as 1-2-3 and works something like this:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Answer each question below based on your personal preferences.</li>
        <li>Click the "Submit" button once completing the form.</li>
        <li>Get your results! The Track Selector Tool will display which language may be best for you.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <form id="form">
      <label for="age">Age</label>
      <input id="age" type="text">
      <label for="gender">Gender</label>
      <select id="gender">
        <option value="female">Female</option>
        <option value="male">Male</option>
      </select>

      <button type="submit" class="btn">Calculate my quote</button>
    </form>

    <div id="quote">
      <p>You will have to pay $<span id="rate"></span> per month to get car insurance. You should probably just bike or take the bus.</p>
