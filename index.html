    <h1>Coding School: Track Selector Tool</h1>

    <p>Thank you for your interest in joining Epicodus - we are glad you're here!</p>
    
    <p>We know choosing to set out on a new adventure of growth and discovery in the world of technology can be a bit overwhelming, but choosing a language to learn is your first step. With that in mind, we have created a simple, easy-to-use tool to hopefully help make that decision easier.</p>

    <p>The Track Selector Tools is as easy as 1-2-3 and works something like this:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Answer each question below based on your personal preferences.</li>
        <li>Click the "Submit" button once completing the form.</li>
        <li>Get your results! The Track Selector Tool will display which language may be best for you.</li>
      </ol>
